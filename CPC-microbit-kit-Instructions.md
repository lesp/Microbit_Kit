## Assembly Instructions  

### IMPORTANT: Machine screws must be finger tight and not tightened using any tools or machinery. Doing so may cause damage to your micro:bit.  

* Insert M4 Countersunk machine screw into the socket marked "0", the screw head should be rest in the socket and face upwards, with the screw thread residing under the micro:bit board.  
* Flip the micro:bit over while holding the machine screw in place.  
* Take 1 nylon M4 washer and slip it over the screw thread.  
* Take 1 nylon M4 nut and loosely attach it to the machine screw thread, leave a gap of around 5mm.  
* Take 1 length of pre-cut wire. Wrap one end of exposed wire around the machine screw. Ensure that the wire is touching the machine screw and is secure.  
* Secure the nut to the machine screw so that the wire is held securely in place between the washer and the nut.  
* Repeat this process for the 4 remaining sockets.  
You should now have all 5 wires secured to each of the GPIO sockets. At the end of each wire there will be an exposed portion of the wire. This end can be inserted into the breadboard.  

## Simple Test of the components  
To test that our kit is working we need to use the following components

A breadboard

Red LED X 1

  
An LED has two "legs".

The longest leg is called the Anode and in a circuit current flows into the LED via this leg.

The shortest leg is called the Cathode and this is connected to Ground, often referred to as GND.

  
We shall be using a breadboard which enables projects to be prototyped and tested by pushing components into the breadboard. 

How a breadboard works is by thin strips of metal stretch horizontally across the board, known as rows, latching on to the components as they are pushed into the hole. Components in the same row are electrically connected, but to build a circuit we will also work vertically, known as columns. In the centre of the board there is a channel that serves as a divider, there is no connection between the two sides of the board, unless we use a component to bridge the divide.

For our first circuit we shall use the wires connected to 3V and GND. Insert the LED as per the illustration, with the long leg of the LED on the left of the board, the short leg of the LED should be inserted on the other side of the board.

Now take the wire from 3V and connect it *in-line *with the long leg of our LED. Now take the wire from GND and connect it*in-line* with the short leg of our LED.
